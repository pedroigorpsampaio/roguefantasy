To correctly pack raw textures and sync with world server map follow these steps!!

1. Make sure raw textures are the same with the server
2. After copying .tmx from server, remember to set width and height of map to 1.
3. Open .tmx in editor to remove raw folder from source file names ex. "tile_000.png" is correct and "novaterra_raw_textures/tile_000.png" is incorrect.
4. Check if DesktopLauncher flag that controls texture packing is set to true.

To pack .jar for desktop, remember to set the pack texture flag to false!
