Correct usage of tiled maps server-side:

1. Separate individually any tile and add them to collection tileset of .tmx (embedded)
2. Build the map with tiled (wall layer must have -5 vertical offset to sync with client trick for collision and draw order)
3. Let the client handle the rest (texture packing, etc...)

For now, try to keep the map within the existing layers, to avoid overloading the network as well as the client rendering.
