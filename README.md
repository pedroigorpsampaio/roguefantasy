# Rogue Fantasy

A MMORPG inspired by Tibia, Ragnarok, Runescape and other games from the early era of MMORPGs. Implemented using LibGDX and Kryonet, this project implements a robust client-server game architecture based on an authoritative server, with client-side prediction, server reconciliation and entity interpolation resulting in a smooth real-time online gameplay. The game's world is in an isometric view inspired by old games of the early era of MMORPGs, fully integrated with Tiled. 

Technology: Java, LibGDX, Kryonet, Dominion, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, AndroidStudio.

# Video

The video available here showcases the general idea of the project and represents the first version of the project. Clipchamp was used to edit the video. Since it only exports in 30fps, Flowframes was used to interpolate to 60fps. This may cause some artifacts in the video.
